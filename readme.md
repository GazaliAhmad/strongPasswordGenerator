# Strong Password

A Python and Java implemention of generating random 16 characters based on ASCII printable characters. The randomly generated is very strong.

According to this [password checker website](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/), password:  `NS#n\5?t0*l1gH[6` will take gazillion years to break!

Ok, I think 41 trillion years qualifies. A trillion is a thousand thousand thousand thousand, twelve zeros. Gazillion `Gaz` is a different sort of number, called indeterminate numbers. It is an arbitrarily large number, with lots of, but no set number of, zeros.

Or you could be lucky!
